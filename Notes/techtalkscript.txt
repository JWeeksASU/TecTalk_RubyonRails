Tech Talk Script

creating a new app and database

	rails new <app_name>

	rails server or rails s for short
		Warning: Issue with release for Windows, go to assets>javascript> remove all required except jquery
					javascript won't work, need to go into config files to fix in each new app which is not practical for demo

	rails generate scaffold  status      name:string content:text
							<db name>  	<field:type>
						
		Notes: 	creates status.rb in app>models directory
				creates schema

	rake db:migrate
		Note: migrates database

Views

	***Open views>statuses>index.html.erb ***
	
		Talk about ERB tags
		Embedded Ruby
		Output-tag: <%= code > outputs value of code following object.property format 
								(example status.name gets name property from current status object)
								
		Helper functions: link_to creates an anchor tag with given text and url (Show and Edit)
								(destroy links back to statuses page but calls method to delete post)
			
			***Open Browser and inspect element to display that html is being outputted by controller to browser***
			
			***Open File to demo partial views app>views>statuses>_form.html.erb ***


			
		Partial Views- represents shared content like the head and body sections
		
		(Major Benefits are that it reduces redundancy, embraces encapsulation from OOP)


			
			***Open File to demo partial views*** app>views>statuses>edit.html.erb ***
			
			Notes: <% render 'form' %> tells controller to render the _form  on that line


		
		***Open File to demo layout*** app>views>layouts.application.html.erb ***
		
		Layouts- is a special view that wraps a page view and gives it a common structure
		
				Notes: yield renders the page view into the layout view
				
			***Add <h1>Treebook</h1> above yield and run server to demo***
			
				Notes: 	Helper methods in head section point to assets
						where rails handles all the .js .css and images
Formatting
	***Add Bootstrap files css/js***
		Note: 	.min are minimized without comments and whitespace to use with final 
			site (Rails does this for us)
		
	*** Open assets>stylesheets>scaffold.css delete contents, explain importance ***
	
	***Add style element around yield***
	
			<div class = "container">
				<% yield %> (this is already there)
			</div>
			
	***Add Navbar after <body>***
			
	<div class = "navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top">
		<div class = "navbar-inner">
			<div class = "container">
				<a href = "#" class="brand">Treebook</a>
				<!--list of links for header-->
				<ul class = "nav">
					<li><%= link_to "All Statuses", statuses_path %></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	***Add CSS to fix header issue assets>stylesheets>application.css***
	
		body{ padding-top: 40px;}
		
Edit Status Class

	***Add CSS for status style in assets>stylesheets>statuses.css***		
		
	// adds solid grey bottom border 1px wide
	.status{
		border-bottom: solid 1px #CCC;
		padding: 5px 0;
	}

	//overides default p styling for statuses
	.status p {
		margin: 4px 0;
	}
